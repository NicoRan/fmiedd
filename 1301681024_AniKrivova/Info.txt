Info about my CRUD project

befor you started it , you need to change a few thing 

1. Ani_Krivova_1301681024_CRUD_Project\CRUD\PhonebookWithACCSESS\ConsolePhonebook\Service
    there is the " AuthenticationService.cs" file
    You need to change the "string conectionstring to" to the right filepath where the access file is.
    It is in folder Ani_Krivova_1301681024_CRUD_Project\CRUD\PhonebookWithACCSESS\ConsolePhonebook\Service

2.Ani_Krivova_1301681024_CRUD_Project\CRUD\CRUD
   there is the "Web.config" file
   You need to change the "conectionstring to" to the right filepath where the access file is.
   For exact info about it , go to Server Explorer where the databases are and look ot the 
   property "connectionstring" of the Data Connections-> Access file
 
3.Go to the Access Database for info about username and password
    I have created a new Username that can have his own contacts  and it's called "stoyan",
    but he has'n got any contacts in the Contact-table yet .You can add some , if you want :)
	
4.There are 3 roles : Admin, Member and Public 
If you access like Admin, you can Create, Read, Update and Delete Contacts
If you access like Member you can only Read your Contacts
