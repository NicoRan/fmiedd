CRUD with Access on Web
==============

with Login
--------------
Create, retrieve, update and delete funcions

*News:*


- You can't add empty record in the database of adresses or in the users database
- You can't add records that already exist
- Shows an error when you try to log in with wrong username/password
- Two types of users (admin and regular)
- Admin can use all of the CRUD funcions, but the regular user can only view the table from the data base
- You can delete users, but only if you know the password, which is "admin"
