 -Before you open Visual studio, copy the content of SQLQuery1.sql in SQL Server Managment Studio and paste it in a new query and excute everything (If there is a database called Users - delete it and create a new one with the same name) 
 -Open danostane.sln in Visual Studio
-change the connection string with the one on your computer 
(in our case the connection string will be: //"Provider=SQLNCLI11;Data Source=FMI-532-0\\SQLEXPRESS;User ID=sa;Password = sa;Initial Catalog=Users"; )
 -Start the application
 -Use "admin" for username and "admin" for password if you want to change the database
 -Use "member" for username and "member" for password if you want just to see the database.
